# hasten_py
Basically https://github.com/thirtysixthspan/hasten but in python.
I wrote this because hasten was pretty inefficient for large files even though all it was effectively doing is printing a string on top and on the bottom. I can't seem to find why he makes it parse the sql statements.

UPDATE: I've redone it in bash to avoid python encoding issues. Much simpler too.
